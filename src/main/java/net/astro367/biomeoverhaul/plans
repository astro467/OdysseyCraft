To obtain the legandary chorusite ingot, you must travel to all 3 dimentions and slay powerfull creatures to obtain the materials
necessary to create it.

First you must travel far into the distant horizon in the overworld and find each of the nine new biomes and the ores that are
found within them. Once you have one of each of the gems you must put them together in a crafting table to create the crystal of tranquility

Next you must venture into the dangarous depths of the nether and locate another set of nine biomes and their respective ores. Once you have
obtained each of them you must combine them in a crafting table to create the inferno crystal

After this you must go to the final dimention, the end and find nine more biomes and collect their ores. These can be used to craft the
crystal of darkness.

Once all three crystals have been obtained, you must also find and defeat the wither, warden, elder gaurdian and ender dragon.
By combining a nether star, a prismarine shard and the four items dropped by the bosses, you may create an eternal crystal

Once you have the eternal crystal, you must search the desolate islands of the end for chorisite ore. When you have obtain at least one
lime chorusite dust and one cyan chorusite dust, you can combine them in the smithing table to create chorusite essance

Chorusite essance can than be combined with a diamond, a netherite ingot and an eternal crystal to craft a unstable chorusite
ingot, which in turn can be smelted into a chorusite ingot which can be used to create chorusite armour and tools
